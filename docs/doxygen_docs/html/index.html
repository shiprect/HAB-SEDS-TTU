<dl class="section user"><dt>Overview</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports.</li>
<li>Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p >Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, and a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager can be used to send and receive messages.</p>
<p >It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.</p>
<p >In some specialised use cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.</p>
<p >A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run on your choice of processor.</p>
<p >Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Drivers</dt><dd></dd></dl>

<dl class="section user"><dt>History</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead was created in April 2014, substantially based on code from some of our other earlier Radio libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram are derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.</li>
<li>RH_RF22 is derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.</li>
<li>RH_RF69 is derived from the RF69 library version 1.2.</li>
<li>RH_ASK is based on the VirtualWire library version 1.26, after significant conversion to C++.</li>
<li>RH_Serial was new.</li>
<li>RH_NRF24 is based on the NRF24 library version 1.12, with some significant changes.</li>
</ul>
<p >During this combination and redevelopment, we have tried to retain all the processor dependencies and support from the libraries that were contributed by other people. However not all platforms can be tested by us, so if you find that support from some platform has not been successfully migrated, please feel free to fix it and send us a patch.</p>
<p >Users of RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram in the previous RF22 library will find that their existing code will run mostly without modification. See the RH_RF22 documentation for more details.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Installation</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries sub-folder of your sketchbook. The example sketches will be visible in in your Arduino, mpide, maple-ide or whatever. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries</a></p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Building for Particle Photon</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>The Photon is not supported by the Arduino IDE, so it takes a little effort to set up a build environment. Heres what we did to enable building of RadioHead example sketches on Linux, but there are other ways to skin this cat.

1.7 2014-05-03<br  />
 Added support for Arduino Due. Tested with RH_NRF905, RH_Serial, RH_ASK. IMPORTANT CHANGE to interrupt pins on Arduino with RH_RF22 and RH_RF69 constructors: previously, you had to specify the interrupt <em>number</em> not the interrupt <em>pin</em>. Arduinos and Uno32 are now consistent with all other platforms: you must specify the interrupt pin number. Default changed to pin 2 (a common choice with RF22 shields). Removed examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out of the box with Flymaple. Removed examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out of the box with ChipKit Uno32. </dd>

 Added support for YIELD in Teensy 2 and 3, suggested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 Documentation updates. Clarify use of headers and Flags<br  />
 Fixed misalignment in RH_RF69 between ModemConfigChoice definitions and the implemented choices which meant you didnt get the choice you thought and GFSK_Rb55555Fd50 hung the transmitter.<br  />
 Preliminary work on Linux simulator. </dd>
<dd>
1.9 2014-05-14 <br  />
 Added support for using Timer 2 instead of Timer 1 on Arduino in RH_ASK when RH_ASK_ARDUINO_USE_TIMER2 is defined. With the kind assistance of Luc Small. Thanks!<br  />

 reduced the default SPI bus speed for RH_NRF24 to 1MHz, since so many modules and CPU have problems with 8MHz.<br  />
 </dd>
<dd>
1.11 2014-05-18<br  />
 Testing RH_RF22 with RFM23BP and 3.3V Teensy 3.1 and 5V Arduinos. Updated documentation with respect to GPIO and antenna control pins for RFM23. Updated documentation with respect to transmitter power control for RFM23<br  />

 Fixed RH_RF22 so that lastRssi() returns the signal strength in dBm. Suggested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 Added support for getLastPreambleTime() to RH_RF69. Requested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 RH_NRF24::init() now checks if there is a device connected and responding, else init() will fail. Suggested by Steve Brown.<br  />
 RHSoftwareSPI now initialises default values for SPI pins MOSI = 12, MISO = 11 and SCK = 13.<br  />
 Fixed some problems that prevented RH_NRF24 working with mixed software and hardware SPI on different devices: a race condition due to slow SPI transfers and fast acknowledgement.<br  />
 </dd>
<dd>
1.17 2014-06-02 <br  />
 Fixed a debug typo in RHReliableDatagram that was introduced in 1.16.<br  />
 RH_NRF24 now sets default power, data rate and channel in init(), in case another app has previously set different values without powerdown.<br  />

See STM32ArduinoCompat.<br  />
 Default modulation for <a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html" title="Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via a LoRa capable radio transceiver.">RH_RF95</a> was incorrectly set to a very slow Bw125Cr48Sf4096 </dd>
<dd>
1.25 2014-07-25 The available() function will longer terminate any current transmission, and force receive mode. Now, if there is no unprocessed incoming message and an outgoing message is currently being transmitted, available() will return false.<br  />
 RHRouter::sendtoWait(uint8_t*, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t) renamed to sendtoFromSourceWait due to conflicts with new sendtoWait() with optional flags.<br  />
 RHMEsh and RHRouter already supported end-to-end application layer flags, but RHMesh::sendtoWait() and RHRouter::sendToWait have now been extended to expose a way to send optional application layer flags. </dd>
